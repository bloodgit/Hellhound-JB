- H&S - Hide n' Seek, blues stay in armoury till a specific amount of time has passed, they must then go out and hunt reds.
- Last Guarding - The last guard on blue kills all reds to end the round, please note that if you are only the blue that whole round, you cannot last guard.
- Warday - Blues will goto a predetermined location on the map at the start of the round (Probably Disco or Bowling), They must stay in this location for atleast 2 minutes whilst the reds come at them and try to kill them, Reds are allowed ammo and are allowed to do anything in their power to kill the blue team, once the 2 minutes is up for the blue team they can walk around the map hunting the red team.

**Common Rules**

- No armoury or medic room camping. (This means staying in those rooms and waiting for others to come to you.)
- No glitching weapons or entities. (T-Model glitching & spawning weapons on red on roundstart, for example.)
- By default, last wardens orders DO NOT apply, this means the new warden has to state "Continue previous wardens orders" to keep those last orders in effect.
- Ghosting is not allowed. (This means talking whilst dead to give out information for the players currently alive, the only exception to this rule being if the people in question are the last red alive & are delaying.)
- No force-baiting. (This means running at the enemy team then walking back to get them to try run at you and hit them.)
- False accusations and / locations whilst not rebelling is not allowed. (As a rebel, you may state where you may be and what you may doing to try confuse the blues, however this cannot be done for more than 3 times per round.)
- No talking over warden. (This applies to the blue & red team.)
- No talking over admins, in any case involving rules and / or admin orders like microphone checks.
- No entering and / or camping in unreachable areas.
- If no orders were given before the cell doors are opened by a warden, it makes that day a freeday.

**Red Team Rules**

- No detouring and / or delaying.
- When asking for a repeat, use !repeat and try to follow what other reds are doing, as when you ask for a repeat YOU ARE NOT entilted to one.
- Custom LRs which involve doing minigames like Hunger Games, can only be done once every two rounds this is to prevent "chaining" special days. (This means you cannot win LR every round and do Hunger Games, for example.)
- Custom LRs which involve players to AFK / AFM, Crouch & Jump repeatedely and / or excessively is not allowed.
- Custom LRs must be able to be completed without ammo or external help.
- Killing blues through the use of lethal taunts makes you a rebel, attempting them does not unless stated otherwise by the warden.
- Successfully hitting guards with projectiles as a prisoner makes you a rebel.
- Freeday abusing is not allowed. (Blocking off areas as a freeday, using buttons to minigames & trying to get them to hit you without rebelling)
- Running from the start of the minigame to the end of the minigame without going through the minigame itself does not count as completing the minigame.
- You may not attempt to kill the warden when LR is being given or when the LR reciever is completing their death request.
- If you are a LR reciever, once the LR has been picked you must give a death request.
- Overall, use common sense, if something doesn't feel right to the players, it's probably not allowed.
- Creating loopholes in these rules will result in you being banned.

**Blue Team Rules**

- Have a good microphone when playing on blue, as when you play on blue you must understand that you are willing to play warden if the current warden dies.
- Freekilling or freehitting is not allowed, and will get you slayed.
- You may kill the current freedays at the end of the round if an LR has been set to avoid delaying, they may not kill you unless the death request states otherwise.
- No camping in areas which involve getting to armoury like vents and teleports.
- You must pay attention to the reds and stay with the warden & his group of prisoners at all times, unless told by the warden to go hunt rebels.
- You may not hunt rebels unless told by the warden.
- Blues may not act on a prisoners word, this means killing someone due to reds saying they are a rebel for example.
- You may last guard as a guard if you are the last guard alive and it was not forced (Meaning doing shark with 2 blue team players and getting the other one killed, for example) or you weren't the only guard when the round started.
- As a warden, you may not order players to chase and kill other players, manipulating bombrush commands (Like markers) to get a player killed is also not allowed.
- You may not favourtise a prisoner, every prisoner should be treated fairly.
- As a warden, you can decide whether you want to give a repeat, if a warden is giving a repeat, do not kill any prisoners until 5 seconds after the repeat has been given.
- As a warden you may not rename prisoners to confusing names such as renaming reds to blues, you are also not allowed to rename them to something which rhymes with the last name they were given. (Renaming reds to deads for example, is not allowed.)
- As a warden you may not give conflicting orders. (For example, telling reds to bombrush to markers & saying reds may not stand on the grass, then put a marker on the grass)
- As a warden you cannot lie.
- When trivia is being played, it must be a common genre picked which everyone should know. (Geography & TF2 related questions for example are allowed, anime and / or server questions from different communities is not allowed.)
